Single Page app with AngularJS

This small basic web app based on AngularJS displays a list of people from a Json file. 
Each entry/person can be then clicked to display a single person's profile with his full info and bio.

It uses Angular Route module (angular-route.min.js) to load the different views/partials of the app (list.html & details.html).

Model: data.json

Controllers: apps.js & controllers.js

Views: list.html & details.html
